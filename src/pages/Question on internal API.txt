Question on internal API
1. Tasks: V3 staff groups - documentation, where is the org id?
2. Connection status - why is this a POST?
3. In the docs, why are the call repeated?
4. Tasks announcements - which paramaters are mandatory? Documentation is not clear.
5. /v1/workflow/tasks/ Documentation does not have all the parameters and no description of STATE options
